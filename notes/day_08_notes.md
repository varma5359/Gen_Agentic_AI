## 3. API and client-server model

### Beginner explanation

An API is a documented way for software components to communicate. A web API commonly uses HTTP.

**Remember:** first understand the purpose. Syntax becomes easier after you know what problem the feature solves.

### Example 1 — start here

```python
client = "Student Portal"
server = "College API"
request = {"method": "GET", "resource": "/students"}
print(client, "asks", server)
print(request)
```

**Expected output**

```text
Student Portal asks College API
{'method': 'GET', 'resource': '/students'}
```

### Walkthrough

The client sends a request. The server processes it and returns a response. This sample only represents the idea.

Read each line aloud. Identify the variable, function, method, operator or statement responsible for the result. Then change one value and predict the new output before running the program again.

### Important methods and syntax

Endpoint, resource, client, server, request body, response body and API documentation.

For each method, remember this pattern: object, dot, method name, parentheses and any required arguments. A function may instead be called directly by its name. Read the documentation when you are unsure about arguments or return values.

### Common mistakes

An API is not necessarily a web page. Many APIs return JSON for another program to consume.

When you see an error, read the exception type and the line number. Check the actual value and type. Fix one problem at a time instead of rewriting the whole program.

### Practice task

Draw the request-response flow for a mobile app retrieving a student profile.

1. Write the smallest working version.
2. Run it with the sample value.
3. Change the input.
4. Try an empty or unexpected input.
5. Explain why the output changed.

### Interview check

1. Define api and client-server model in simple language.
2. Explain how the example works.
3. Name one important method or syntax feature.
4. Explain one common mistake.
5. Give one real application use case.

### Beginner-to-intermediate bridge

After the beginner example works, improve it by adding meaningful names, a small function, input validation and a test. Do not add a framework before you understand the Python behavior.

---

## 4. HTTP methods

### Beginner explanation

HTTP methods describe what a client wants to do with a resource.

**Remember:** first understand the purpose. Syntax becomes easier after you know what problem the feature solves.

### Example 1 — start here

```python
methods = ["GET", "POST", "PUT", "PATCH", "DELETE"]
for method in methods:
    print(method)
```

**Expected output**

```text
GET
POST
PUT
PATCH
DELETE
```

### Walkthrough

GET commonly reads; POST commonly creates or submits; PUT commonly replaces; PATCH partially updates; DELETE requests removal.

Read each line aloud. Identify the variable, function, method, operator or statement responsible for the result. Then change one value and predict the new output before running the program again.

### Important methods and syntax

Safe and idempotent method concepts, method semantics and API-specific contracts.

For each method, remember this pattern: object, dot, method name, parentheses and any required arguments. A function may instead be called directly by its name. Read the documentation when you are unsure about arguments or return values.

### Common mistakes

Do not assume all APIs implement methods identically. Read the API documentation. Never put secrets in URL query strings.

When you see an error, read the exception type and the line number. Check the actual value and type. Fix one problem at a time instead of rewriting the whole program.

### Practice task

Choose a method for listing, creating, replacing, partially updating and deleting a student.

1. Write the smallest working version.
2. Run it with the sample value.
3. Change the input.
4. Try an empty or unexpected input.
5. Explain why the output changed.

### Interview check

1. Define http methods in simple language.
2. Explain how the example works.
3. Name one important method or syntax feature.
4. Explain one common mistake.
5. Give one real application use case.

### Beginner-to-intermediate bridge

After the beginner example works, improve it by adding meaningful names, a small function, input validation and a test. Do not add a framework before you understand the Python behavior.

---

## 5. Status code families

### Beginner explanation

Status codes tell a client the broad result of a request.

**Remember:** first understand the purpose. Syntax becomes easier after you know what problem the feature solves.

### Example 1 — start here

```python
codes = {200:"OK", 201:"Created", 400:"Bad Request", 401:"Unauthorized", 403:"Forbidden", 404:"Not Found", 500:"Server Error"}
for code, label in codes.items():
    print(code, label)
```

**Expected output**

```text
200 OK
201 Created
400 Bad Request
401 Unauthorized
403 Forbidden
404 Not Found
500 Server Error
```

### Walkthrough

2xx indicates success; 3xx redirection; 4xx client/request issue; 5xx server issue.

Read each line aloud. Identify the variable, function, method, operator or statement responsible for the result. Then change one value and predict the new output before running the program again.

### Important methods and syntax

Know 200, 201, 204, 400, 401, 403, 404, 409, 422, 429 and 500.

For each method, remember this pattern: object, dot, method name, parentheses and any required arguments. A function may instead be called directly by its name. Read the documentation when you are unsure about arguments or return values.

### Common mistakes

401 usually concerns authentication; 403 means access is refused. 429 often signals rate limiting. Follow the API contract.

When you see an error, read the exception type and the line number. Check the actual value and type. Fix one problem at a time instead of rewriting the whole program.

### Practice task

Match common API situations to suitable status code families.

1. Write the smallest working version.
2. Run it with the sample value.
3. Change the input.
4. Try an empty or unexpected input.
5. Explain why the output changed.

### Interview check

1. Define status code families in simple language.
2. Explain how the example works.
3. Name one important method or syntax feature.
4. Explain one common mistake.
5. Give one real application use case.

### Beginner-to-intermediate bridge

After the beginner example works, improve it by adding meaningful names, a small function, input validation and a test. Do not add a framework before you understand the Python behavior.

---

## 6. Headers and JSON bodies

### Beginner explanation

Headers carry metadata. A JSON body carries structured data sent with a request or response.

**Remember:** first understand the purpose. Syntax becomes easier after you know what problem the feature solves.

### Example 1 — start here

```python
headers = {"Accept":"application/json", "Content-Type":"application/json"}
payload = {"name":"Anu", "department":"CSE"}
print(headers["Content-Type"])
print(payload["name"])
```

**Expected output**

```text
application/json
Anu
```

### Walkthrough

Accept describes a response format the client can process. Content-Type describes the body format being sent.

Read each line aloud. Identify the variable, function, method, operator or statement responsible for the result. Then change one value and predict the new output before running the program again.

### Important methods and syntax

Authorization headers, caching headers, content negotiation and correlation IDs.

For each method, remember this pattern: object, dot, method name, parentheses and any required arguments. A function may instead be called directly by its name. Read the documentation when you are unsure about arguments or return values.

### Common mistakes

Keep API keys out of source code. Use HTTPS and the authentication scheme required by the service.

When you see an error, read the exception type and the line number. Check the actual value and type. Fix one problem at a time instead of rewriting the whole program.

### Practice task

Describe a POST request with a JSON body and appropriate headers.

1. Write the smallest working version.
2. Run it with the sample value.
3. Change the input.
4. Try an empty or unexpected input.
5. Explain why the output changed.

### Interview check

1. Define headers and json bodies in simple language.
2. Explain how the example works.
3. Name one important method or syntax feature.
4. Explain one common mistake.
5. Give one real application use case.

### Beginner-to-intermediate bridge

After the beginner example works, improve it by adding meaningful names, a small function, input validation and a test. Do not add a framework before you understand the Python behavior.

---

## 7. Calling APIs with requests

### Beginner explanation

requests is a synchronous HTTP client. Check status and parse response data carefully.

**Remember:** first understand the purpose. Syntax becomes easier after you know what problem the feature solves.

### Example 1 — start here

```python
# Install: python -m pip install requests
import requests
response = requests.get("https://httpbin.org/get", timeout=10)
print(response.status_code)
response.raise_for_status()
data = response.json()
print(data["url"])
```

**Expected output**

```text
200
https://httpbin.org/get
```

### Walkthrough

get() sends the request. timeout limits waiting. raise_for_status() raises for unsuccessful HTTP status. json() parses the body.

Read each line aloud. Identify the variable, function, method, operator or statement responsible for the result. Then change one value and predict the new output before running the program again.

### Important methods and syntax

params= for query values, json= for JSON bodies, headers= for headers, Session() for connection reuse.

For each method, remember this pattern: object, dot, method name, parentheses and any required arguments. A function may instead be called directly by its name. Read the documentation when you are unsure about arguments or return values.

### Common mistakes

A response may not contain JSON. Catch RequestException and JSON decoding errors when appropriate.

When you see an error, read the exception type and the line number. Check the actual value and type. Fix one problem at a time instead of rewriting the whole program.

### Practice task

Write a function that calls a public test endpoint and returns one selected field.

1. Write the smallest working version.
2. Run it with the sample value.
3. Change the input.
4. Try an empty or unexpected input.
5. Explain why the output changed.

### Interview check

1. Define calling apis with requests in simple language.
2. Explain how the example works.
3. Name one important method or syntax feature.
4. Explain one common mistake.
5. Give one real application use case.

### Beginner-to-intermediate bridge

After the beginner example works, improve it by adding meaningful names, a small function, input validation and a test. Do not add a framework before you understand the Python behavior.

---

## 8. API reliability and security

### Beginner explanation

A robust API client handles expected failures and protects credentials.

**Remember:** first understand the purpose. Syntax becomes easier after you know what problem the feature solves.

### Example 1 — start here

```python
import os
api_key = os.getenv("DEMO_API_KEY")
if not api_key:
    print("API key is not configured")
else:
    print("API key is available")
```

**Expected output**

```text
API key is not configured (when the environment variable is absent)
```

### Walkthrough

getenv() reads an environment variable. The example does not print the secret itself.

Read each line aloud. Identify the variable, function, method, operator or statement responsible for the result. Then change one value and predict the new output before running the program again.

### Important methods and syntax

Timeouts, bounded retries, exponential backoff, status validation, safe logs and environment configuration.

For each method, remember this pattern: object, dot, method name, parentheses and any required arguments. A function may instead be called directly by its name. Read the documentation when you are unsure about arguments or return values.

### Common mistakes

Never print or commit API keys. Do not retry every error blindly; distinguish transient failures from invalid requests.

When you see an error, read the exception type and the line number. Check the actual value and type. Fix one problem at a time instead of rewriting the whole program.

### Practice task

Add timeout and error handling to your API client. Test missing configuration.

1. Write the smallest working version.
2. Run it with the sample value.
3. Change the input.
4. Try an empty or unexpected input.
5. Explain why the output changed.

### Interview check

1. Define api reliability and security in simple language.
2. Explain how the example works.
3. Name one important method or syntax feature.
4. Explain one common mistake.
5. Give one real application use case.

### Beginner-to-intermediate bridge

After the beginner example works, improve it by adding meaningful names, a small function, input validation and a test. Do not add a framework before you understand the Python behavior.

# Deep teaching workbook — guided labs and mentor walkthroughs

This workbook is part of the class lesson. Complete each lab with your trainer; do not treat it as optional filler.

## Guided classroom lab 1: Learning objectives

### Step 1 — Say the idea in everyday language
Today's idea is "Learning objectives". Before typing code, explain what problem this feature solves. Use an example from a college, student portal, chat application or simple business process.

Ask yourself:
- What information do I start with?
- What action does the program perform?
- What result should I see?
- What should happen if the input is missing?
- What should happen if the input is the wrong type?

### Step 2 — Read the smallest example
Open the first code example in this lesson. Read it from top to bottom.
Do not run it immediately.
Underline the variable names.
Circle the function or method name.
Mark the input values.
Mark the line that produces the result.
Write a one-sentence explanation beside every important line.

### Step 3 — Predict before execution
Write down what you expect the program to display.
Run the program once.
Compare the actual result with your prediction.
If the result differs, do not randomly change the code.
Check the value, type, order of operations and indentation.
Run the smallest part that reproduces the difference.

### Step 4 — Change one thing at a time
Change one input value.
Predict the new result.
Run the program again.
Restore the original value.
Change a second value.
Predict again.
Run again.
Explain the difference between the two results.

### Step 5 — Trace the program
Use a notebook to make a trace table.

| Step | Variable or operation | Value before | Action | Value after |
|---:|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | First input | Empty | Supply sample input | Sample input |
| 2 | First operation | Sample input | Apply the lesson concept | Intermediate result |
| 3 | Second operation | Intermediate result | Continue processing | Final result |
| 4 | Output | Final result | Display or return | Visible result |

Fill the table with the actual values from your program.
Do not copy the words 'sample input' into every cell; write the real values.

### Step 6 — Beginner coding challenge
Build a tiny program that demonstrates "Learning objectives" without using a framework.
Use no more than three variables at first.
Use one small function if the concept requires a function.
Use sample values that a college student can understand.
Print the result with a clear label.
Run the program.
Change one input.
Run it again.
Explain the change.

### Step 7 — Make the program safer
Ask what could go wrong if the user supplies an empty value.
Ask what could go wrong if the user supplies a different data type.
Ask what could go wrong if the collection has no items.
Ask what could go wrong if a requested key or index does not exist.
Choose a suitable validation or exception-handling approach.
Do not catch every possible exception without understanding it.
Show the user a helpful message when an expected problem occurs.

### Step 8 — Improve readability
Use names that describe the meaning of each value.
Keep one operation per line while learning.
Add a short comment only when it explains a reason that is not obvious.
Remove code that is no longer used.
Keep the example small enough to explain aloud.
Do not compress beginner code into a clever one-liner.

### Step 9 — Explain the concept to another person
Start with a one-sentence definition.
Describe why a developer needs it.
Walk through the example.
Explain the expected output.
Describe one common error.
Give one practical application.
Ask the other person to change an input and predict the result.

### Step 10 — Trainer observation
The trainer should ask the student to close the notes.
The student should recreate the smallest example.
The student should explain each important line.
The student should modify one input without help.
The student should identify one limitation.
The trainer should correct misunderstandings before moving forward.

### Independent practice record
- [ ] I explained the concept in simple words.
- [ ] I typed the example myself.
- [ ] I predicted the output.
- [ ] I ran the code successfully.
- [ ] I changed an input and explained the result.
- [ ] I tested one unusual input.

## Guided classroom lab 4: API and client-server model

### Step 1 — Say the idea in everyday language
Today's idea is "API and client-server model". Before typing code, explain what problem this feature solves. Use an example from a college, student portal, chat application or simple business process.

Ask yourself:
- What information do I start with?
- What action does the program perform?
- What result should I see?
- What should happen if the input is missing?
- What should happen if the input is the wrong type?

### Step 2 — Read the smallest example
Open the first code example in this lesson. Read it from top to bottom.
Do not run it immediately.
Underline the variable names.
Circle the function or method name.
Mark the input values.
Mark the line that produces the result.
Write a one-sentence explanation beside every important line.

### Step 3 — Predict before execution
Write down what you expect the program to display.
Run the program once.
Compare the actual result with your prediction.
If the result differs, do not randomly change the code.
Check the value, type, order of operations and indentation.
Run the smallest part that reproduces the difference.

### Step 4 — Change one thing at a time
Change one input value.
Predict the new result.
Run the program again.
Restore the original value.
Change a second value.
Predict again.
Run again.
Explain the difference between the two results.
