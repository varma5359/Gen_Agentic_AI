## 3. Modules and imports

### Beginner explanation

A module is a Python file containing reusable names. import lets another file use those names.

**Remember:** first understand the purpose. Syntax becomes easier after you know what problem the feature solves.

### Example 1 — start here

```python
import math
print(math.sqrt(25))
from pathlib import Path
print(Path("notes.txt").suffix)
```

**Expected output**

```text
5.0
.txt
```

### Walkthrough

math.sqrt() calculates a square root. Path.suffix returns the filename extension.

Read each line aloud. Identify the variable, function, method, operator or statement responsible for the result. Then change one value and predict the new output before running the program again.

### Important methods and syntax

import module, from module import name, aliases and __name__ == "__main__".

For each method, remember this pattern: object, dot, method name, parentheses and any required arguments. A function may instead be called directly by its name. Read the documentation when you are unsure about arguments or return values.

### Common mistakes

Naming your file json.py or random.py can shadow a standard-library module. Check the working directory if imports fail.

When you see an error, read the exception type and the line number. Check the actual value and type. Fix one problem at a time instead of rewriting the whole program.

### Practice task

Create helper.py and import one function from it into main.py.

1. Write the smallest working version.
2. Run it with the sample value.
3. Change the input.
4. Try an empty or unexpected input.
5. Explain why the output changed.

### Interview check

1. Define modules and imports in simple language.
2. Explain how the example works.
3. Name one important method or syntax feature.
4. Explain one common mistake.
5. Give one real application use case.

### Beginner-to-intermediate bridge

After the beginner example works, improve it by adding meaningful names, a small function, input validation and a test. Do not add a framework before you understand the Python behavior.

---

## 4. Packages and project layout

### Beginner explanation

A package groups related modules in folders. It helps organize a growing application.

**Remember:** first understand the purpose. Syntax becomes easier after you know what problem the feature solves.

### Example 1 — start here

```python
# project/
#   app/
#     __init__.py
#     text_tools.py
#   main.py
# main.py:
from app.text_tools import clean_text
print(clean_text("  Hello  "))
```

**Expected output**

```text
Hello
```

### Walkthrough

Python finds the app package and imports clean_text from text_tools.py.

Read each line aloud. Identify the variable, function, method, operator or statement responsible for the result. Then change one value and predict the new output before running the program again.

### Important methods and syntax

Organize by responsibility: routes, services, schemas, database, config and utilities. Use absolute imports for clarity in many applications.

For each method, remember this pattern: object, dot, method name, parentheses and any required arguments. A function may instead be called directly by its name. Read the documentation when you are unsure about arguments or return values.

### Common mistakes

ModuleNotFoundError can result from wrong paths, misspelled names or running from the wrong working directory.

When you see an error, read the exception type and the line number. Check the actual value and type. Fix one problem at a time instead of rewriting the whole program.

### Practice task

Design a package with separate modules for prompt formatting and text cleaning.

1. Write the smallest working version.
2. Run it with the sample value.
3. Change the input.
4. Try an empty or unexpected input.
5. Explain why the output changed.

### Interview check

1. Define packages and project layout in simple language.
2. Explain how the example works.
3. Name one important method or syntax feature.
4. Explain one common mistake.
5. Give one real application use case.

### Beginner-to-intermediate bridge

After the beginner example works, improve it by adding meaningful names, a small function, input validation and a test. Do not add a framework before you understand the Python behavior.

---

## 5. Exceptions and try/except

### Beginner explanation

An exception signals that something went wrong during execution. try/except lets you handle expected failures.

**Remember:** first understand the purpose. Syntax becomes easier after you know what problem the feature solves.

### Example 1 — start here

```python
try:
    age = int("twenty")
except ValueError:
    print("Enter a whole number")
else:
    print(age)
finally:
    print("Input check finished")
```

**Expected output**

```text
Enter a whole number
Input check finished
```

### Walkthrough

int() raises ValueError. except handles it. finally runs whether or not an exception occurred.

Read each line aloud. Identify the variable, function, method, operator or statement responsible for the result. Then change one value and predict the new output before running the program again.

### Important methods and syntax

Catch specific exception types, raise meaningful errors, chain exceptions and use custom exceptions when appropriate.

For each method, remember this pattern: object, dot, method name, parentheses and any required arguments. A function may instead be called directly by its name. Read the documentation when you are unsure about arguments or return values.

### Common mistakes

Bare except can hide programming errors. Do not silently ignore an exception. Preserve useful diagnostic information.

When you see an error, read the exception type and the line number. Check the actual value and type. Fix one problem at a time instead of rewriting the whole program.

### Practice task

Ask for marks and handle non-numeric input.

1. Write the smallest working version.
2. Run it with the sample value.
3. Change the input.
4. Try an empty or unexpected input.
5. Explain why the output changed.

### Interview check

1. Define exceptions and try/except in simple language.
2. Explain how the example works.
3. Name one important method or syntax feature.
4. Explain one common mistake.
5. Give one real application use case.

### Beginner-to-intermediate bridge

After the beginner example works, improve it by adding meaningful names, a small function, input validation and a test. Do not add a framework before you understand the Python behavior.

---

## 6. Reading and writing files

### Beginner explanation

Files let programs store information beyond one run. with manages the file resource and closes it automatically.

**Remember:** first understand the purpose. Syntax becomes easier after you know what problem the feature solves.

### Example 1 — start here

```python
with open("message.txt", "w", encoding="utf-8") as file:
    file.write("Hello learner")
with open("message.txt", "r", encoding="utf-8") as file:
    content = file.read()
print(content)
```

**Expected output**

```text
Hello learner
```

### Walkthrough

w writes and replaces existing content. r reads. read() returns the file contents as a string.

Read each line aloud. Identify the variable, function, method, operator or statement responsible for the result. Then change one value and predict the new output before running the program again.

### Important methods and syntax

read(), readline(), readlines(), write(), append mode, pathlib.Path.read_text() and write_text().

For each method, remember this pattern: object, dot, method name, parentheses and any required arguments. A function may instead be called directly by its name. Read the documentation when you are unsure about arguments or return values.

### Common mistakes

Wrong paths raise FileNotFoundError. w can overwrite a file. Use a to append and validate file locations.

When you see an error, read the exception type and the line number. Check the actual value and type. Fix one problem at a time instead of rewriting the whole program.

### Practice task

Save a student's question and read it back.

1. Write the smallest working version.
2. Run it with the sample value.
3. Change the input.
4. Try an empty or unexpected input.
5. Explain why the output changed.

### Interview check

1. Define reading and writing files in simple language.
2. Explain how the example works.
3. Name one important method or syntax feature.
4. Explain one common mistake.
5. Give one real application use case.

### Beginner-to-intermediate bridge

After the beginner example works, improve it by adding meaningful names, a small function, input validation and a test. Do not add a framework before you understand the Python behavior.

## 7. JSON serialization

### Beginner explanation

JSON is a text format for exchanging structured data. Python's json module converts dictionaries and lists to and from JSON.

**Remember:** first understand the purpose. Syntax becomes easier after you know what problem the feature solves.

### Example 1 — start here

```python
import json
student = {"name": "Anu", "marks": 85}
json_text = json.dumps(student, indent=2)
print(json_text)
restored = json.loads(json_text)
print(restored["name"])
```

**Expected output**

```text
{
  "name": "Anu",
  "marks": 85
}
Anu
```

### Walkthrough

dumps() creates JSON text. loads() parses JSON text. dump() and load() work directly with file objects.

Read each line aloud. Identify the variable, function, method, operator or statement responsible for the result. Then change one value and predict the new output before running the program again.

### Important methods and syntax

JSON supports objects, arrays, strings, numbers, booleans and null. Python None maps to JSON null. Use ensure_ascii and indent when needed.

For each method, remember this pattern: object, dot, method name, parentheses and any required arguments. A function may instead be called directly by its name. Read the documentation when you are unsure about arguments or return values.

### Common mistakes

Invalid JSON raises JSONDecodeError. JSON object keys are strings. Avoid serializing arbitrary Python objects without a clear schema.

When you see an error, read the exception type and the line number. Check the actual value and type. Fix one problem at a time instead of rewriting the whole program.

### Practice task

Save application settings in settings.json and load them safely.

1. Write the smallest working version.
2. Run it with the sample value.
3. Change the input.
4. Try an empty or unexpected input.
5. Explain why the output changed.

### Interview check

1. Define json serialization in simple language.
2. Explain how the example works.
3. Name one important method or syntax feature.
4. Explain one common mistake.
5. Give one real application use case.

### Beginner-to-intermediate bridge

After the beginner example works, improve it by adding meaningful names, a small function, input validation and a test. Do not add a framework before you understand the Python behavior.

---

## 8. Logging

### Beginner explanation

Logging records events and errors with severity levels. It is more configurable than print statements.

**Remember:** first understand the purpose. Syntax becomes easier after you know what problem the feature solves.

### Example 1 — start here

```python
import logging
logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO, format="%(levelname)s:%(message)s")
logging.info("Application started")
logging.warning("No question supplied")
```

**Expected output**

```text
INFO:Application started
WARNING:No question supplied
```

### Walkthrough

basicConfig configures the root logger. info() and warning() record messages at different levels.

Read each line aloud. Identify the variable, function, method, operator or statement responsible for the result. Then change one value and predict the new output before running the program again.

### Important methods and syntax

DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR and CRITICAL; module-level loggers; file handlers; structured logs and exception logging.

For each method, remember this pattern: object, dot, method name, parentheses and any required arguments. A function may instead be called directly by its name. Read the documentation when you are unsure about arguments or return values.

### Common mistakes

Never log passwords, API keys or unnecessary personal information. Avoid swallowing errors after logging.

When you see an error, read the exception type and the line number. Check the actual value and type. Fix one problem at a time instead of rewriting the whole program.

### Practice task

Add logs to a file-reading utility and record successful reads and failures.

1. Write the smallest working version.
2. Run it with the sample value.
3. Change the input.
4. Try an empty or unexpected input.
5. Explain why the output changed.

### Interview check

1. Define logging in simple language.
2. Explain how the example works.
3. Name one important method or syntax feature.
4. Explain one common mistake.
5. Give one real application use case.

# Deep teaching workbook — guided labs and mentor walkthroughs

This workbook is part of the class lesson. Complete each lab with your trainer; do not treat it as optional filler.

## Guided classroom lab 1: Learning objectives

### Step 1 — Say the idea in everyday language
Today's idea is "Learning objectives". Before typing code, explain what problem this feature solves. Use an example from a college, student portal, chat application or simple business process.

Ask yourself:
- What information do I start with?
- What action does the program perform?
- What result should I see?
- What should happen if the input is missing?
- What should happen if the input is the wrong type?

### Step 2 — Read the smallest example
Open the first code example in this lesson. Read it from top to bottom.
Do not run it immediately.
Underline the variable names.
Circle the function or method name.
Mark the input values.
Mark the line that produces the result.
Write a one-sentence explanation beside every important line.

### Step 3 — Predict before execution
Write down what you expect the program to display.
Run the program once.
Compare the actual result with your prediction.
If the result differs, do not randomly change the code.
Check the value, type, order of operations and indentation.
Run the smallest part that reproduces the difference.

### Step 4 — Change one thing at a time
Change one input value.
Predict the new result.
Run the program again.
Restore the original value.
Change a second value.
Predict again.
Run again.
Explain the difference between the two results.

### Step 5 — Trace the program
Use a notebook to make a trace table.

| Step | Variable or operation | Value before | Action | Value after |
|---:|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | First input | Empty | Supply sample input | Sample input |
| 2 | First operation | Sample input | Apply the lesson concept | Intermediate result |
| 3 | Second operation | Intermediate result | Continue processing | Final result |
| 4 | Output | Final result | Display or return | Visible result |

Fill the table with the actual values from your program.
Do not copy the words 'sample input' into every cell; write the real values.

### Step 6 — Beginner coding challenge
Build a tiny program that demonstrates "Learning objectives" without using a framework.
Use no more than three variables at first.
Use one small function if the concept requires a function.
Use sample values that a college student can understand.
Print the result with a clear label.
Run the program.
Change one input.
Run it again.
Explain the change.

### Step 7 — Make the program safer
Ask what could go wrong if the user supplies an empty value.
Ask what could go wrong if the user supplies a different data type.
Ask what could go wrong if the collection has no items.
Ask what could go wrong if a requested key or index does not exist.
Choose a suitable validation or exception-handling approach.
Do not catch every possible exception without understanding it.
Show the user a helpful message when an expected problem occurs.

### Step 8 — Improve readability
Use names that describe the meaning of each value.
Keep one operation per line while learning.
Add a short comment only when it explains a reason that is not obvious.
Remove code that is no longer used.
Keep the example small enough to explain aloud.
Do not compress beginner code into a clever one-liner.

### Step 9 — Explain the concept to another person
Start with a one-sentence definition.
Describe why a developer needs it.
Walk through the example.
Explain the expected output.
Describe one common error.
Give one practical application.
Ask the other person to change an input and predict the result.

### Step 10 — Trainer observation
The trainer should ask the student to close the notes.
The student should recreate the smallest example.
The student should explain each important line.
The student should modify one input without help.
The student should identify one limitation.
The trainer should correct misunderstandings before moving forward.

### Independent practice record
- [ ] I explained the concept in simple words.
- [ ] I typed the example myself.
- [ ] I predicted the output.
- [ ] I ran the code successfully.
- [ ] I changed an input and explained the result.
- [ ] I tested one unusual input.

## Guided classroom lab 4: Modules and imports

### Step 1 — Say the idea in everyday language
Today's idea is "Modules and imports". Before typing code, explain what problem this feature solves. Use an example from a college, student portal, chat application or simple business process.

Ask yourself:
- What information do I start with?
- What action does the program perform?
- What result should I see?
- What should happen if the input is missing?
- What should happen if the input is the wrong type?

### Step 2 — Read the smallest example
Open the first code example in this lesson. Read it from top to bottom.
Do not run it immediately.
Underline the variable names.
Circle the function or method name.
Mark the input values.
Mark the line that produces the result.
Write a one-sentence explanation beside every important line.

### Step 3 — Predict before execution
Write down what you expect the program to display.
Run the program once.
Compare the actual result with your prediction.
If the result differs, do not randomly change the code.
Check the value, type, order of operations and indentation.
Run the smallest part that reproduces the difference.

### Step 4 — Change one thing at a time
Change one input value.
Predict the new result.
Run the program again.
Restore the original value.
Change a second value.
Predict again.
Run again.
Explain the difference between the two results.

### Step 5 — Trace the program
Use a notebook to make a trace table.

| Step | Variable or operation | Value before | Action | Value after |
|---:|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | First input | Empty | Supply sample input | Sample input |
| 2 | First operation | Sample input | Apply the lesson concept | Intermediate result |
| 3 | Second operation | Intermediate result | Continue processing | Final result |
| 4 | Output | Final result | Display or return | Visible result |

Fill the table with the actual values from your program.
